1. 	Use generic views, especially in projects

2. 	Make website prettier - bootstrap, proper theme. Split up some CSS into apps. Perhaps "static" folder could live in "pages" app? Then we could get rid of horrible absolute path to its folder in settings.py

3.	Use a whole bunch of javascript (and AJAX?) in the projects app, so that everything can load in just one page. 

4.	Add a base-projects.html template

5.	Add a visual aid for site location
