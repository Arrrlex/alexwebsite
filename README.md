This is my personal website, featuring my CV and a (small, as yet) portfolio of programming work.

##Things left to do:

2. Overhaul theme using bootstrap (add better site navigation and location)
4. Add a base-projects template
5. Make projects app one-page using JQuery and Angular
6. Add more applets
