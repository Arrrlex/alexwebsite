This is my personal website, featuring my CV and a (small, as yet) portfolio of programming work.

##Things left to do:

1. Use generic views
2. Overhaul theme using bootstrap (add better site navigation and location)
3. Move root "static" folder to pages app
4. Finish projects app (make functional)
5. Add a base-projects template
6. Make projects app one-page using JQuery etc.
